## üìñ Project Overview

Dataset-Bit is an open-source tool for building fine-tuning datasets for large language models (LLMs). It supports smart chunking of various document formats, automatic/manual generation of high-quality Q&A pairs, flexible scoring and export, making it suitable for developers, data annotation teams, and AI researchers.

### ‚ú® Key Features
- **Smart Document Chunking**: Upload documents in multiple formats, support various chunking strategies and custom parameters.
- **AI Q&A Generation**: Batch-select chunks and automatically generate high-quality Q&A pairs with progress visualization.
- **AI Q&A Scoring**: Support manual 5-star scoring and batch AI auto-scoring, with real-time result saving.
- **Flexible Data Export**: Export in Alpaca, ShareGPT, and other formats, filter high-quality Q&A pairs by star rating.
- **Flexible System Configuration**: Support flexible parameter configuration and custom options to meet personal needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.8+ + SQLite
- **Frontend**: Vue3 + Element Plus + Vanilla JS
- **AI Model**: Supports OpenAI/custom API, both scoring and Q&A generation are configurable

## Quick Start

### 1. Pull the image

```bash
docker pull yorko/dataset-bit:latest
```

### 2. Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 yorko/dataset-bit:latest
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Advanced Usage (Docker Compose)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: yorko/dataset-bit:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
      - APP_PORT=8000
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start the service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Notes

- The image includes an initialized `dataset_bit.db` database and all files in the `uploads` directory at build time.
- For persistent data, it is recommended to mount the `/app/uploads` and `/app/exports` directories.
